# title:        Working with HTML (Part 2)
# description:  This is the second of two units on Discourse Theme HTML, and the 
#               fifth unit in the Discourse Theme Development course. When 
#               you're ready to start, clone this unit theme and start watching 
#               it on the [Discourse Theme Creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org).
#
#               ### When reading on Pavilion Education
#
#               If you're taking this unit on [Pavilion Education](https://education.thepavilion.io),
#               mark the ``self review`` steps ``Complete`` when you've completed 
#               them. If a step is marked ``peer review`` or ``teacher review`` 
#               post a comment on the step with your answer(s) and check "Request 
#               Review" to notify your peers or course teacher(s) who can mark 
#               your step as complete if they're happy with your work.
#
#               There's a video of a teacher completing the unit in the final 
#               step, which you'll be able to watch once all other steps are
#               complete.
#
#               ### When reading the code
#
#               If you're reading this in the unit theme code, the last step in 
#               a file will tell you where to go to find the next step (if there 
#               is one). If you can't find it, do a search for ``learning_step`` 
#               in the theme folder in your code editor to see all the steps in 
#               the unit. All units start in the START file and end in the 
#               FINISH file.
