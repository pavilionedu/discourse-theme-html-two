title:       Plugin outlets in script tags
description: Now that we've had a look at where theme HTML is inserted in the 
             Rails application layout and the Ember application template, and 
             what components and plugin outlets are, let's have a look at an 
             example that uses those concepts.

             One way you can insert HTML into a plugin outlet is by using a 
             special ``<script>``. It looks like this:

             ```
             <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="/connectors/topic-category/more-assignments"></script>
             ```

             If you insert a script tag with the ``type`` "text/x-handlebars" and
             with the ``data-template-name`` set according to this scheme below, 
             the code enclosed in the tag will be interpreted as a handlebars 
             template to be inserted in the ``plugin_outlet_name`` plugin outlet.

             #### data-template-name scheme

             ```
             /connectors/<plugin_outlet_name>/<anything>
             ```

             You can add a script tag like this in the ``head_tag.html`` or 
             ``body_tag.html`` and it will insert its contents into whatever
             plugin outlet appears in the ``data-template-name`` attribute.

title:       Using a plugin outlet in a script tag
description: Have a look at the script tag in the example below. If you go
             into a topic on the Theme Creator you'll see what HTML it's adding,
             just under the topic title.

             See if you can find the plugin outlet it's using in the Discourse 
             codebase. Rather than just doing a search for the plugin outlet 
             name (which is what you normally should do), start off by looking 
             in the ``topic.hbs`` template we looked at in the previous unit. 

             You won't find the plugin outlet in ``topic.hbs``, but see if you
             can find what component it is in by reading that template, then 
             find the template for that component. When you're developing a theme 
             being able to read a template file and then find the templates for 
             the components it uses is a useful skill.

             Finally, see if you can find the template for the component that's 
             rendering the button. Don't worry about how that works for now,
             instead, do a search in the templates folder for other places where 
             that button template is used in Discourse.

             ```
             app/assets/javascripts/discourse/app/templates
             ```
             ([GitHub link](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/app/assets/javascripts/discourse/app/templates))

             See if you can match up other examples of where the button component 
             is used to buttons you can see in the Discourse UI.

exercise:    Respond in the comments with

             - a link to the component javascript and template containing the
               plugin outlet being used in the example

             - a link to a place where the button component is used, and a 
               screenshot of the same button in the UI.

title:       Configuring the button component
description: Once you've looked at a few examples of how the button component is
             used, see if you can do the following just based on those other 
             examples and some things we covered in the previous units:

             - Add an icon to the button

             - Disable the button

             - Make the button red

             - Make a loading spinner appear on the button

             You'll need to make some educated guesses based off what your search
             for the component in the templates folder turned up.

title:       Override a template in a script tag
description: The other aspect of working with templates that you'll often use in
             a theme is overriding an existing template in Discourse. You can
             also do this using a special ``<script>`` tag anyhere in the HTML.
             The code below is overriding the template for the button component 
             we used in the previous step.

             First, take a look at the ``data-template-name`` attribute. When 
             overriding a template, we use the following pattern:

             - ``/components/<component_name>`` if it's a component template

             - ``<template_name>`` if it's a page template (e.g. "application", or "topic")

             When you override a template, your code gets applied instead of the 
             ``discourse`` template. Be careful with this. If you do actually
             override the ``d-button`` template you're changing the HTML for 
             nearly every button you see in Discourse!

             But let's give that a go anyway. Change the template override below
             so that the icon you added to the button in the previous step appears 
             to the right of the text in the button.

<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="/components/d-button">
  {{#if icon}}
    {{#if isLoading}}
      {{~d-icon "spinner" class="loading-icon"~}}
    {{else}}
      {{~d-icon icon~}}
    {{/if}}
  {{else}}
    {{#if isLoading}}
      {{~d-icon "spinner" class="loading-icon"~}}
    {{/if}}
  {{/if}}

  {{~#if computedLabel~}}
    <span class="d-button-label">{{html-safe computedLabel}}{{#if ellipsis}}&hellip;{{/if}}</span>
  {{~/if~}}

  {{yield}}
</script>

title:       Wrapping HTML in a component
description: Before we move on, take another look at the ``{{yield}}`` block at 
             the bottom of the ``d-button`` template. What do you think that 
             does? To get an idea, try changing our ``d-button`` component in 
             Step 11 to the following:

             ```
             {{#d-button}}
               <a href="/c/school/theme-assignments" style="color: black">
                 Find more theme assignments
               </a>
             {{/d-button}}
             ```

             When you refresh the page in the theme creator the button will look
             exactly the same as before! But it's actually a bit different. How
             is it different? Inspect the HTML in your browser to get a sense 
             of what changes between the two approaches, and what {{yield}} 
             might be doing there.
